Python Challenge - Module 3 - 20240108 - Ryan MacFarlane - UTA-VIRT-DATA-PY-12-2023-U-LOLC-MTTH - Readme File

All code in both scrips was written by myself, Ryan MacFarlane.  However, I did receive help and guidance from my tutor, David Chao.

Coding was done in Visual Studio Code and has been tested and cleaned.

Thank you for viewing/grading!
